### What is this repository for? ###

A simple Java application that provides a single endpoint VOIP service, that emulates different types of network conditions and the measures used to remediate any issues caused by said network conditions.

This has only been tested to work on local networks.

Built a custom checksum for this, which I am pretty proud about, even though it may not be the best or most reliable checksum, really happy I built my own instead of using an external dependency.

### How do I get set up? ###

You can checkout the develop branch to build and compile the project yourself.
The master branch includes the report associated with the project, and a distributable .jar file.
